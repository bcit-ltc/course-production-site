            <h1>Course Production: Getting Started and Using Teamwork</h1>
            <p><a href="https://bcit.teamwork.com">Teamwork</a> is the project management tool that we use to communicate and collaborate during all the phases of course production.</p>
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Do you have a new project that you would like to add to Teamwork? The first two things to do are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Notify <a href="mailto:courseproduction@bcit.ca">Course Production</a>, and</li>
                <li>Add the project to Teamwork. This way, we will have the course on our radar.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you do not yet have a Teamwork account, please contact <a href="mailto:courseproduction@bcit.ca">courseproduction@bcit.ca</a> and provide your name and BCIT ID number.</p>
            <h2>Teamwork Steps</h2>
            <figure class="img large">

            </figure>
            <div class="accordion">
                <h2>1. Start: Add Project to Teamwork</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click on Projects, then click on the green "Add Project" button in the top right corner.</li>
                    <li>
                        An "Add Project" pop-up window will appear.
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Fill in the project name under "What's the Project Name?" Be sure to include the acronym and number of the course name if available (i.e. COMP 1956: Creating Web Graphics 1).</li>
                            <li>Click on the "Advanced" tab and under "Category," select the appropriate category for your project. Most BCIT courses will fall under "Individual Course Development" and "Online &amp; Blended."</li>
                            <li>Click "Add Project."</li>
                        </ol>

                <h2>2. Design and Develop Course Materials</h2>
                <p>This is the phase where content is designed, written, edited and multimedia is built, etc. The Course Production team is usually not involved (but available to answer any questions) during this phase.</p>
                <h2>3. Upload Files to Teamwork</h2>
                <p>When your content is written, finalized, and ready to be converted from Word to HTML, it is time to upload the files to Teamwork.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Upload all files to Teamwork (this could include any media assets, pdfs, other attachments, etc.). To upload:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Click on "Files" in the Navigation bar.</li>
                            <li>Click on the green "Upload Files" button in the top right corner. An "Upload Files" pop-up window will appear.</li>
                            <li>Click the blue "Add Files" button and choose the file(s) that you would like to upload.</li>
                            <li>Choose a category (i.e. Module 2) for which the file is to be uploaded to.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <figure class="img">

                    <li>Upload files to the appropriate module folder so that the Course Production Specialist (CPS) can easily find and use the correct assets.</li>

                    <h2>Important!</h2>
                    <p>If there is more than one version of the final Word document in a module folder, the CPS will use best judgment to work off the most recent word document. Please ensure that the final Word document to be converted is clearly marked and/or older draft versions are deleted.</p>

                        <p>Now that the project has been created, we need to add individual tasks.</p>
                        <ol>

                        </ol>

                        <p>When a task is assigned to Course Production, we will get an email notifying us that there is something new in Teamwork. We can then start preparing the task for production.</p>

                            <li>Next to the task that you would like to assign, hover over the word "Anyone" until you see a pencil icon. Click on the pencil icon.</li>
                            <li>Under "Who should do this?" select Course Production.</li>
                            <li>Click the green "Save Changes" button.</li>

                    <ul>
